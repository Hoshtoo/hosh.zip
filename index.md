# ./whoami

My name is Hoshtoo, also known as Stew, and I am a Cybersecurity and Computer Science Dual Major at the University of North Georgia with a Minor in Intelligence and a 4.0 GPA. 

I graduated High School with my Associate's degree in Computer Science in Spring 2024, and have been attending UNG since. I am currently the Red Team Captain for the CyberHawks at UNG and compete with the Blue Team as well. I have also served as the Operations Lead for the CyberHawks, and been an active participant in the Cyber Specialty Unit at UNG as a student presenter and coach. 

I am the rank of Pro Hacker on HackTheBox and hold certifications such as the GIAC Experienced Incident Handler, GIAC Certified Incident Handler, GIAC Security Essentials, GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies, CompTIA Security+, and plenty more. 

My main focuses have been on Penetration Testing and Reverse Engineering, but I am spending a lot of time right now learning about Web Exploitation and Binary Exploitation.
